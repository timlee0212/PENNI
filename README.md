## Acknowledgement

The resnet-56 implementation is from: [pytorch_resnet_cifar10](https://github.com/akamaster/pytorch_resnet_cifar10)

We count the FLOPs number with the modified version of [pytorch-OpCounter](https://github.com/Lyken17/pytorch-OpCounter)

The ImageNet training script is derived from [apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex)
